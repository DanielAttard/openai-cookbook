    "# How to handle rate limits\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call the OpenAI API repeatedly, you may encounter error messages that say `429: 'Too Many Requests'` or `RateLimitError`. These error messages come from exceeding the API's rate limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate limits are a common practice for APIs, and they're put in place for a few different reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, they help protect against abuse or misuse of the API. For example, a malicious actor could flood the API with requests in an attempt to overload it or cause disruptions in service. By setting rate limits, OpenAI can prevent this kind of activity.\n",
    "- Second, rate limits help ensure that everyone has fair access to the API. If one person or organization makes an excessive number of requests, it could bog down the API for everyone else. By throttling the number of requests that a single user can make, OpenAI ensures that everyone has an opportunity to use the API without experiencing slowdowns.\n",
    "- Lastly, rate limits can help OpenAI manage the aggregate load on its infrastructure. If requests to the API increase dramatically, it could tax the servers and cause performance issues. By setting rate limits, OpenAI can help maintain a smooth and consistent experience for all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although hitting rate limits can be frustrating, rate limits exist to protect the reliable operation of the API for its users.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we'll share some tips for avoiding and handling rate limit errors."

    "### Retrying with exponential backoff\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy way to avoid rate limit errors is to automatically retry requests with a random exponential backoff. Retrying with exponential backoff means performing a short sleep when a rate limit error is hit, then retrying the unsuccessful request. If the request is still unsuccessful, the sleep length is increased and the process is repeated. This continues until the request is successful or until a maximum number of retries is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has many benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatic retries means you can recover from rate limit errors without crashes or missing data\n",
    "- Exponential backoff means that your first retries can be tried quickly, while still benefiting from longer delays if your first few retries fail\n",
    "- Adding random jitter to the delay helps retries from all hitting at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that unsuccessful requests contribute to your per-minute limit, so continuously resending a request wonâ€™t work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few example solutions."

    "## How to maximize throughput of batch processing given rate limits\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're processing real-time requests from users, backoff and retry is a great strategy to minimize latency while avoiding rate limit errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you're processing large volumes of batch data, where throughput matters more than latency, there are a few other things you can do in addition to backoff and retry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proactively adding delay between requests\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are constantly hitting the rate limit, then backing off, then hitting the rate limit again, then backing off again, it's possible that a good fraction of your request budget will be 'wasted' on requests that need to be retried. This limits your processing throughput, given a fixed rate limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, one potential solution is to calculate your rate limit and add a delay equal to its reciprocal (e.g., if your rate limit 20 requests per minute, add a delay of 3 seconds to each request). This can help you operate near the rate limit ceiling without hitting it and incurring wasted requests.\n",
